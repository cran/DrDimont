Description: While it has been well established that drugs affect and help
  patients differently, personalized drug response predictions remain
  challenging. Solutions based on single omics measurements have been proposed,
  and networks provide means to incorporate molecular interactions into reasoning.
  However, how to integrate the wealth of information contained in multiple omics
  layers still poses a complex problem.
  We present a novel network analysis pipeline, DrDimont, Drug response prediction
  from Differential analysis of multi-omics networks. It allows for comparative
  conclusions between two conditions and translates them into differential drug
  response predictions. DrDimont focuses on molecular interactions. It establishes
  condition-specific networks from correlation within an omics layer that are
  then reduced and combined into heterogeneous, multi-omics molecular networks.
  A novel semi-local, path-based integration step ensures integrative conclusions.
  Differential predictions are derived from comparing the condition-specific
  integrated networks. DrDimont's predictions are explainable, i.e., molecular
  differences that are the source of high differential drug scores can be retrieved.
  Our proposed pipeline leverages multi-omics data for differential predictions,
  e.g. on drug response, and includes prior information on interactions.
