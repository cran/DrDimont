\title{Combines individual layers to a single graph}
\usage{
generate_combined_graphs(
  graphs,
  annotations,
  inter_layer_connections,
  settings
)
}
\arguments{
\item{graphs}{[list] A named list (elements `groupA` and `groupB`). Each element contains a list of
iGraph objects (`graphs` from output of \code{\link[DrDimont]{generate_individual_graphs}}).}

\item{annotations}{[list] A named list (elements `groupA`, `groupB` and `both`). Each element contains a
list of data frames mapping each node IDs to identifiers. `both` contains unique identifiers across the
whole data. (`annotations` from output of \code{\link[DrDimont]{generate_individual_graphs}})}

\item{inter_layer_connections}{[list] Named list with specified inter-layer connections. Names are
layer names and elements are connections (\link[DrDimont]{make_connection}).}

\item{settings}{[list] A named list containing pipeline settings. The settings list has to be
initialized by \code{\link[DrDimont]{drdimont_settings}}. Items in the named list can be
adjusted as desired.}
}
\value{
A named list (elements `graphs` and sub-elements `$groupA` and
`$groupB`, and `annotations` and sub-element `both`). Contains the igraph objects of the combined
network and their annotations for both groups.
}
\description{
Individual graphs created by \code{\link[DrDimont]{generate_individual_graphs}}
are combined to a single graph per group according to `inter_layer_connections`. Returns a
list of combined graphs along with their annotations.
